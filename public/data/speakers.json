At Auth0 we’re trying to make authentication and identification as easy as possible, while still keeping it secure. After office hours he likes to play around with the web-audio API, and other “exotic” browser API’s. One of his side projects is a library to add audio effects to an audio input using JavaScript.  When he's not behind a computer, you can find him playing the guitar, having a beer at a concert, or trying to snap the next perfect picture.",

    "description": "Hello human, I'm a strong believer that... HAL didn't do anything to harm Dave, he(?) was truly preoccupied with his friend safety. Also the answer to life, the universe and everything seems to (still) be 42.  At night I'm fighting crime... oh wait; wrong bio here. Here it goes the uncensensored version: for several years now, I've been developing mobile applications. First on the energy consumption field, then Telco and, in the middle, of it I've found the time to create a game with some friends - Word Dare - it was fun! I'm currently working at WIT Software on the company RCSe applications - first for iOS and now on Android.  From time to time, I like to make long monologues and wait for the entire audience to fall asleep - lets call them \"talks\". I've been giving a few for University of Coimbra, WIT Software, DevFest, Pixels Camp, mdevcon, etc.",
