At Auth0 we’re trying to make authentication and identification as easy as possible, while still keeping it secure. After office hours he likes to play around with the web-audio API, and other “exotic” browser API’s. One of his side projects is a library to add audio effects to an audio input using JavaScript.  When he's not behind a computer, you can find him playing the guitar, having a beer at a concert, or trying to snap the next perfect picture.",
