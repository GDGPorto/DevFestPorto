Also the answer to life, the universe and everything seems to (still) be 42.  At night I'm fighting crime... oh wait; wrong bio here. Here it goes the uncensensored version: for several years now, I've been developing mobile applications. First on the energy consumption field, then Telco and, in the middle, of it I've found the time to create a game with some friends - Word Dare - it was fun! I'm currently working at WIT Software on the company RCSe applications - first for iOS and now on Android.  From time to time, I like to make long monologues and wait for the entire audience to fall asleep - lets call them \"talks\". I've been giving a few for University of Coimbra, WIT Software, DevFest, Pixels Camp, mdevcon, etc.",
