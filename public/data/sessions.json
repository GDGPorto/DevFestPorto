    "des": "As long as we’ve been using the internet, and way before that, we have been authenticating through some sort of username and password combination. It has become the standard. With the ever increasing number of web-apps, we’re seeing more and more data breaches as well. What if we could build our authentication processes in a way the user doesn’t need a password? In this talk I will give a quick overview of the past, present and future of authentication. From basic authentication to passwordless biometric authentication using the web authentication API, and everything in between. The audience does not need any specific knowledge as this talk will not go into implementation details, but aims to give a view of what’s to come in terms of authentication."

In this talk we will go over just why everyone seems to love this new kid on the block, how to get started with it and debunk some myths about GraphQL. The objective is that you leave this talk as excited as me about GraphQL."

At the end of the talk, you will understand the decisions behind Flutter, why it is so different from others mobile development tools and platforms and why is so many developers already addicted to it. I will also showcase how to build a small working app and how structure a project."

As a contributor, I had to work on projects I didn’t know much as a maintainer I had to make sure the project was ready and friendly to outside contributors.

    "des": "Developers, developers, developers. I’ve always thought that it is amazing what we do - we never settle, we always try to figure out new things, test new things and improve the ones on which we work daily; whether it’s a newly found library, a new architecture pattern that suddenly started to be trending or in this particular case a new language called Kotlin - rejoice! However those things have different impacts on our projects - using a new library has a different risk than adopting a new language and this is where things get… or as you will hear got really complicated. For the past years I’ve been trying to evangelise - wololooo - [read this with Age Of Empires priests voice] the people at my company and community into taking the step of gradually start using Kotlin on our applications. And it hasn’t been an easy task. First, not everyone shares the same enthusiasm in learning something new and secondly making the shift of leaving a language which they know and are familiar with to a new one requires time (both for companies and for people). Fast forward to the present and currently we have Kotlin code in production, a team thrilled with learning new things and managers glad that all deadlines have been successfully accomplished."

After learning how to use Firebase, Google Analytics and other tools, I’ve learned how to turn that abstract into real. A user into a person.<br>In this talk we will explore how we use analytic streams to paint a picture of what our average user looks like. I’ll share some tips we’ve picked up over the years and how thinking in terms of people can level up your product."

    "des": "Android projects can be difficult to maintain, especially when the team is fairly big or when there's little to no upfront planning. Complexity will increase and, if not cared for, so will technical debt and compilation times. Though having separate modules might seem like the obvious approach when starting a project, that's not how it always plays out, therefore modularisation may be a nearing challenge for an increasing number of projects. Modularisation is not without some complicated challenges that will make you question is usefulness. In this talk we'll document our initial approach to modularising XING's Android project, the challenges we faced and what we hope to achieve. Hopefully it will help you think about what your project needs and motivate you into solving some of the problems you might be facing everyday."

A migration that happened (mostly) without anyone noticing.<br>In particular, a brief overview of areas at Echo on Go / gRPC / Typescript / GraphQL (an entirely typed stack) and monitoring along with details of actual system designs."
